**Introduction**

In the fast paced game of hockey, the neutral zone stands as a decisive area where the outcome of the game can hinge on split-second decisions. The swift and precise choices required in this zone can often determine the value of your possession, and ultimately, the game. To increase scoring opportunities, players must make the right choices when gaining possession in the neutral zone. This paper seeks to examine the impact that different actions taken in the neutral zone have on the value of a possession.  By understanding the values added or removed by taking different actions, this study aims to equip players with the knowledge to make informed decisions when they gain possession.
